# What's this?
The idea behind this project was to create a simple way to make phase portraits in 2D and 3D in Python, as we couldn't find something similar on the internet, so we got down to work. (Update: found [jmoy/plotdf](https://github.com/jmoy/plotdf), offers similar 2D phase plots but it is very limited).

Eventually, we did some work on bifurcations, 1D maps and chaos in 3D trayectories.

This idea came while taking a course in non linear dynamics and chaos, during the 3rd year of physics degree, brought by our desire of visualizing things and programming.



We want to state that we are self-taught into making this kind of stuff, and we've tried to make things as *professionally* as possible, any comments about improving our work are welcome!

<!-- ## **Disclaimer:**

**Today's date (July 2021), we've decided to cease our work on this project (for the moment, as we have to move on other things). Therefore, this is the 'final' version of the project, there are no more features incoming. We've tried to leave the code documentated and with good organisation in case someone wants to carry on with some idea! Cheers** -->
